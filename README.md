Experimenting with Box2D in Monkey
==================================

Prerequisites
-------------

One needs to install the box2d monkey module to get this to work.

This happens to be downloadable on the [old google code project](https://code.google.com/p/monkeybox2d/downloads/detail?name=monkeybox2d_1_0_12.zip)

What this attempts to do
------------------------

* First, make a pendulum with a ball and a bar (kind of done)
* Next, we want to have the pendulum hanging from the ceiling
	* Make the ceiling
	* Connect the bar to the ceiling
* Next, apply a force to the ball and see how things are going
* Next, have the mouse control the thing.
